## Description

A quiz on JavaScript for learners to test their knowledge.

This was a very challenging project, as it was the most complex I have worked on in my programming journey so far. Through it, I learnt so much about how all the different topics I learnt in the past weeks come together.

While I did bump into some challenges on the way, I learnt the importance of taking everything step by step and breaking bigger features into small tasks. Pseudo-coding every part of it was very helpful, as well as making sense of my code by reading it 'aloud' as I wrote it.

Overall, this is a project I am very proud of, and that I am happy to share in its complete form.

When users first enter the page, they get a greeting message explaining a little about the quiz. In the left corner, they can click to see the highscores. In the right corner, they can see the timer showing the amount of time left until the quiz ends, representing their score.

To start the quiz, users need to press the 'Start Quiz' button. Then, they have to select an answer from the four presented choices. A message will confirm whether their choice was correct or wrong, along with a sound effect. For every wrong answer, 10 seconds will be substracted from the total time left.

At the end of the game, users can save their highscores by adding their initials and clicking 'submit'. A window alert will confirm whether the submission was successful.

By clicking on the 'View Highscores' link, users can see their highscores in order, with the possibility to clear the scores, and go back to the quiz start page.

## Credits

Overall instruction and provision of necessary materials for this project from the EdX Front-End Web Development Bootcamp instructor and teaching assistants (Oct2023 Cohort).

Special thanks to my EdX academic tutor Sandra Smith for her support in helping me understand the concepts I needed to implement in this project.

Additionally, a few resources and tutorials were very helpful in guiding me towards the completion of this task and learning JavaScript overall:
